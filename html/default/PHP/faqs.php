					<a href="#navigation" id="linkOne">How do I place a custom order?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockOne">
						There are three ways to do this:
						<ul>
							<li>MODIFY ANY ONE OF OVER A HUNDRED OF OUR ORIGINAL UNIFORM DESIGNS!Get on our DRAFT BOARD to select a specific team-sport, pick a uniform design you like then add your own color scheme, logos, team name and preferred fonts and lettering lay-out. You create the look you want! You can even order & pay for it online!</li>
							<li>EMAIL YOUR OWN DESIGN to orders@allensportswear.com.</li>
							<li>REPLICATE AND RECREATE. Find an existing uniform that you like and our design team will replicate it with your team and player details. (Note: Allen Sportswear will not copy any trademarked logos or copyrighted material).</li>
						</ul>
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkTwo">Is there anything else I need to know about ordering custom uniforms for a team?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockTwo">
						From experience, our repeat customers have learned to order extra uniforms sets beyond their actual need. 
						This is a helpful contingency for new players coming into the team, or if you intend to use the same uniforms for the next few years.
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkThree">Can I request for one of your product samples?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockThree">
						We do our best to upload and update photos of the actual products. If you need samples to present to a league or an approving body, please call us at 1877 MY ALLEN (692-5536) to inquire about product sample availability.
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkFour">Can I request for a sample of my actual order?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockFour">
						For medium to large orders, it is our policy to make a Production Sample first and then we email a digital picture for your approval. If you need us to send an  actual product, please allow more time for production and delivery of your full order.
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkFive">What critical information do I need to complete an order?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockFive">
						Having your team name, player names, player numbers (optional), sizes, and other special requests (longer inseams, etc) on-hand will help to move the ordering process along.
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkSix">Can I get help if I am not sure of the design I want?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockSix">
						We’re here to help! Please call us at 1877 MY ALLEN (692-5536) and let us know what’s on your mind. Within 1 business day you’ll have several design options to choose from.
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkSeven">What kind of files do you accept?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockSeven">
						We accept jpg, bmp, pdf, psd, gif and tiff files for picture submissions
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkEight">What is the minimum order quantity?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockEight">
						For uniform sets (top and bottom) we have a 10 set minimum. If you are ordering jerseys or bottoms separately, the minimum is 20 jerseys, or 20 bottoms.
					</blockquote>

					<a href="#navigation" id="linkNine">How can I check the status of my order?</a><br>
					<blockquote id="blockNine">
						You may inquire via email at tracking@allensportswear.com or call us at 1877 MY-ALLEN. If the order has already been shipped we will email the tracking number to you.
